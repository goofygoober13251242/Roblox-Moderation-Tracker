# Roblox-Moderation-Tracker
The Roblox Moderation Tracker is an automated script that monitors suspicious users on Roblox and sends updates to Discord. It gathers information on banned players, reported users, hidden groups, suspicious chat logs, banned friends, and more.

🔍 Features:
✅ Tracks banned and reported users
✅ Scans chat logs for grooming, NSFW, scams, hacking, and illegal activities
✅ Detects banned history & moderation status
✅ Monitors users' last online time
✅ Checks their groups (including hidden/private groups)
✅ Finds banned friends & flags them as high-risk accounts
✅ Prevents duplicate users from being scanned repeatedly
✅ Sends all collected data to a Discord webhook every 3 minutes



📂 How It Works:
1️⃣ Randomly selects a new user ID (from 2010 onward)
2️⃣ Fetches user information from the Roblox API
3️⃣ Scans chat logs for suspicious messages
4️⃣ Checks the user's groups and banned friends
5️⃣ Sends a detailed report to Discord
